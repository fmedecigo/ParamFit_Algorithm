# ParamFit Algorithm  

ParamFit is an algorithm for outline fitting based on a parametric function designed to represent simple closed curves. It employs the Levenberg-Marquardt method to optimize fitting parameters, ensuring high accuracy across various applications.  

### ðŸš€ Features  
- **Closed curve fitting** using a flexible parametric function.  
- **Optimization with Levenberg-Marquardt**, leveraging well-defined initial conditions.  
- **Fitting validation** through metrics such as Jaccard index, \( R^2 \), RMSE, and residual error.  
- **Applicable to different domains**, including seed outlines, diatoms, and geometric curves.  

### ðŸ“‚ Contents  
- MATLAB code for parametric fitting.  
- Implementation of the optimization algorithm.  
- Test data for different applications.
